# RunOver App

### The application briefly shows the distance that the user has walked or run by drawing a line on the map based on the current location. It calculates the distance traveled and the time taken to cover it. The records are stored in Firebase. Additionally, the real-time weather conditions are displayed based on the user's current location during the running session.

I developed this application during my internship at Ba≈üarSoft Information Solutions company.
